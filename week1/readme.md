TODO: Reflect on what you learned this week and what is still unclear.
Originally, I am from a Civil Engineering background and my knowledge of computers has only been limited to using Microsoft Office programs, Windows/Mac OS applications and a variety of Internet sites - so, in short, I am completely new to the programming world.

In Week 1, I have learnt that :
(1) CODE1161 is completely different to my initial expectations. I thought the course would revolve around physical modelling techniques using 3-D Printing machines. I was completely unaware of the fact I would be using a Laptop for the entirety of the semester.
(2) The CODE1161 course outline, assessments, and other content will be on the following website instead of moodle: https://design-computing.github.io/code1161/
(3) Students will be undertaking 3 major tasks this Semester: 
- Using Python 3.7 via a company called GitHub. 
- Machine Learning
- Data Analysis Project...?
(4) Coding exercises for Python 3.7 are accessed via Desktop Visual Studio, which in turn accesses it through GitHub. 
(5) Using the print function with words between apostrophes/double quotation marks outputs those words into the Debug Console. 
(6) I have to be regular with emails sent through the UNSW STUDENT EMAIL address. 

From Week 1 CODE1161 classes, I still do not know the following:
(1) What does debugging mean?
(2) What is the purpose of coding using Python? Can't we use other software. 
(3) How do I 'Push' code into the GitHub base?
(4) Is everything I code seen by the Tutor/Demonstrator?
(5) How do the Assignments/Exercises get marked by the software/tutor?
(6) What is a 'dev' environment?
(7) What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
(8) What is an SCM?
(9) How do I prepare well for this course so I can comfortably flow through with ease? 
(10) What is a terminal?
(11) What is a repo?
